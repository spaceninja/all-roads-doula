        <h3>About Annie</h3>
        <p>I am a Postpartum Doula training with CAPPA and I took many different paths to get here. I have worked in client’s homes in other capacities as a nanny and in home elder care and am comfortable working with a variety of family structures. I have a B.S. in Sociology from PSU and love helping families. I have two children and have personally experienced postpartum anxiety/depression and understand the value of someone bringing over a helping hand and a listening ear after a baby is born.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about people being supported on their birthing/parenting journeys. There are 100 ways to do it right as my mentor says. Babies come into families in all kinds of ways and I  hope to be a supportive arm on your path to parenthood.</p>
        <p>This piece of your journey can look many different ways depending on your needs. We can meet before baby is born to plan and set things up, or I can come in for extra support at whatever point is needed in those first couple months. I can come for 1 day or 100.  I am happy to have a transitional meeting around 3 months to set you up for success moving forward as well. I consider it my honor to work myself out of a job… so you can move forward on solid footing.</p>

        <h3>What is a Postpartum Doula?</h3>
        <p>A Postpartum Doula is a non-medical support person for a family that has been recently joined by one or more new babies. The Doula’s primary concern is the well being of the birthing person and their immediate surroundings so they can care for the new arrival to the best of their abilities. The Doula offers practical and emotional support and education as needed. The Doula has knowledge of local supports and other professionals to refer the family to for issues beyond the scope of the Postpartum Doula.</p>
