        <h3>About Annie</h3>
        <p>
          I am a CAPPA trained Postpartum Doula and board member of the Portland Doula Association.
          Currently my focus is on new parent education and baby wearing. Helping new families
          flourish and find their footing so they can confidently move forward as a new unit is dear
          to my heart. I am excited to always be learning and deepening my skills to bring practical
          and emotional support to parents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why me? I am passionate about providing direct service to families and I am comfortable
          with all family structures. What lights me up is feeding people, seeing new parents relax
          with a baby on their chest, supporting a birthing person’s new body and processing birth
          stories. I believe the fourth trimester is not so much about bouncing back but moving
          toward…
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked with families for many years in various settings and after starting my own I
          kept coming back to the idea of the beginning. Everyone deserves a strong start and it is
          my honor to be part of a family’s team to have the best beginning possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          After earning a B.S. in Sociology and serving in Americorps I have almost exclusively
          worked with families...as a nanny, in home care provider, day center attendant and CNA. I
          have also enjoyed working in maternity and baby retail and birthing two children along the
          way. I am passionate about providing quality service to families wherever you are on your
          journey.

        <h3>What is a Postpartum Doula?</h3>
        <p>
          A Postpartum Doula is a non-medical support person for a family that has been recently
          joined by one or more new babies. The Doula’s primary concern is the well being of the
          birthing person and their immediate surroundings so they can care for the new arrival to
          the best of their abilities. The Doula offers practical and emotional support and
          education as needed. The Doula has knowledge of local supports and other professionals to
          refer the family to for issues beyond the scope of the Postpartum Doula.
